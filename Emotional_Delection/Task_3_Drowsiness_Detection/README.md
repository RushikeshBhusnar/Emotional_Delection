# Task 3: Drowsiness Detection Model

This task builds a model to detect whether a person is asleep or awake in a vehicle. The model can detect multiple people in an image or video, identify how many are present, and determine how many are sleeping. Sleeping people are marked in red, and their ages are predicted. A pop-up message shows the number of sleeping people and their ages.

## Features
- Detect multiple people in images/videos
- Mark sleeping people in red
- Predict age of sleeping people
- Pop-up message with count and ages
- GUI for both image and video input

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook for model training
- Streamlit app for predictions
- Example images/videos and results
