# Task 5: Emotion Detection through Voice

This task builds a model to detect emotions from audio files. The model processes both recorded voices and uploaded voice notes through a GUI. It works exclusively with female voices; if a non-female voice is uploaded, it prompts the user to upload a female voice instead.

## Features
- Detect emotions from audio files (recorded or uploaded)
- Works only with female voices (prompts otherwise)
- GUI for upload and recording

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook for model training
- Streamlit app for predictions
- Example audio files and results
