# Task 7: Age and Emotion Detection for Movie Theatre

This task builds a model for real-time age detection in a horror movie theatre. The model detects age, marks <13 or >60 as "Not allowed" (red rectangle), predicts emotion for ages 13-60, and stores all data in a CSV file.

## Features
- Detect age in images
- Mark <13 or >60 as "Not allowed" (red rectangle)
- Predict emotion for ages 13-60
- Store age, emotion, and entry time in CSV
- (Optional) GUI for image input and preview

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook for model training
- (Optional) Streamlit app for predictions
- Example images and results
